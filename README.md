# JavaScript Quiz Application

Backend repo: https://github.com/bkandaris/frontend-interview-be

### `Why did I build this project?`

This application is a fun way to learn or study JavaScript! It was fun to build something that myself and others could use while growing my skills as a developer. The application has a backend that I can add, update, or delete questions to as I continue learning more.

### `What did I learn?`

With a recent update to [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/getting-started/overview) this gave me an opportunity to go through the documentation and learn what has changed. While planning the application, I improved and practiced structuring data to be displayed to the user. Using redux for state management made handling state throughout the application a breeze.
